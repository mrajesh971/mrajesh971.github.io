  <h3>Emotion Detection Using Video Logs</h3>
  <p>The real time video stream from the tutoring system is used to detect a student's engagement levels. Patterns in facial action unit intensities is exploited to identify the causual emotional state in a student. The research studies the interactions between student emotion,  engagement, learning and system design. This work was funded by US Department of Defense and is under NDA.</p>
  <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/GeneralizedLearningUtilities/SuperGLU" >RL as a Service for Smarter Tutoring</a></h3>
  <p>Reinforcement Learning is used to pick the best next pedagogical action that is personalized to a student's state in a tutoring system. This is built as a service in a generalized library, available for consumption by an tutoring system. (<a href="https://github.com/GeneralizedLearningUtilities/SuperGLU">SuperGLU</a>). This work is a property of US Army Research Lab (<a href = "https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm">ARL</a>).</br>

  <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/Shamya/EmotionDetectionInteractionLogs">Emotion Detection Using Interaction Logs</a></h3>
  <p>Towards building a cost effective emotional state detector for tutoring systems, the zero dollar solution is to exploit the interaction logs of a student. The best classifiers performed 38% better than chance. Needs more data and feature engineering. No third party tool was used. </br>

    <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/Shamya/ZebraSwish">ZebraSwish</a></h3>
    <p>
Professor Gerald Downes at UMass biology department studies zebrafish locomotive behavior by making mutations to genes and then observing changes in how they swim away from a tactile stimulus. This needs tracking the angle between the body axis and the tail tip throughout a high-speed video. ZebraSwish automates this task by using deep learning techniques. </p>
    <p> Task: <i>Object Recognition [Computer Vision]</i></br>
      Models: <i>CNN, Image Processing</i></br>
